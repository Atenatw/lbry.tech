When developing for LBRY, having LBC (LBRY credits) makes it easier to develop applications and interface with our APIs.

To qualify for free LBC you must:

- have a GitHub account, and
- have a public PR (pull request) in the past year

If this sounds like you, <a href="#" class="no-smooth" id="get-started">get started here</a>!

If you have not downloaded our SDK yet, [you should]() and generate a wallet address so we know where to send your LBC!
